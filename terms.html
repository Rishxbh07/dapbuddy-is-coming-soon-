    </ul>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Hosts must be 18+. Members under 18 require parental/guardian consent. The parent/guardian is legally responsible for the minor’s actions.</p>

    <h2>3. Platform Role & Legal Position</h2>
    <p>DapBuddy is a <strong>matchmaking facilitator</strong> matching Hosts & Members based on location. We do NOT sell or provide subscription services. We condemn piracy. We do NOT guarantee compliance with third-party ToS and are NOT liable for bans or restrictions by third-party providers.</p>
    <p><strong>Host Responsibility:</strong> If Host credentials are weak, reused, or misconfigured, and their account is hacked, this is solely the Host’s responsibility.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Users must provide accurate data, not engage in fraud/harassment, not take payments “off-platform,” and not misuse or redistribute Host access.</p>

    <h2>5. Host Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Hosts must provide accurate listings, maintain valid subscriptions for the Tenure, and deliver access within the delivery windows (Max 24 hours). Failure results in auto-cancellation & refund.</p>

    <h2>6. Fees, Pricing & Joining Fee</h2>
    <p>DapBuddy sets the Base Price, Platform Fee, and Access Protection Fee. Hosts cannot set custom prices.</p>

    <h2>7. Access Protection Fee (APF)</h2>
    <p>The APF is a one-time protection fee active only while Member stays continuous in the same group. It is lost if the Member misses payment after the grace period (up to 3 days).</p>

    <h2>8. Multiple Groups</h2>
    <p>A Member may have only 1 active group per service per account. A Member cannot Host and be a Member of the same service simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>9. Rejoining Rules</h2>
    <p>If a Member leaves or misses renewal, they must repay the Joining Fee upon rejoining.</p>

    <h2 id="refunds">10. Refund Policy</h2>
    <h3>10.1 Non-refundable scenarios</h3>
    <p>Change of mind, personal preference change, or voluntary cancellation.</p>
    <h3>10.2 Refund-eligible scenarios</h3>
    <p>Refunds MAY be provided when: Host fails to provide access, Host listing is fraudulent, Host downgrades subscription, or Member provides verifiable evidence.</p>
    <h3>10.3 Usage Threshold Rule</h3>
    <p>If Member uses over 40% of Tenure, refund may be partial. This is not an automatic denial but evaluated case-by-case.</p>

    <h2>11. Disputes & Investigations</h2>
    <p>Disputes are allowed only during active Tenure. Logs are retained for 50 days. DapBuddy decisions are final.</p>
